You must have heard the *Haoni* Puzzle. In order to have a quick understanding of haoni puzzle, you may like to click this link followed:[wiki_haoni](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B1%89%E8%AF%BA%E5%A1%94)

And you may notice that there are some important concepts behind the *Haoni* puzzle, I would like to simply present them below, you can absolutely have a deeper understanding if intersted:
+ **Self-similarity**ï¼Œfor more please see: https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%87%AA%E7%9B%B8%E4%BC%BC
+ **Recursive function**, for more please see: https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8E%9F%E5%A7%8B%E9%80%92%E5%BD%92%E5%87%BD%E6%95%B0
+ **Arbitrary initial configuration**, 

Besides, I think I must introduce 3Blue1Brown to you who is really a brillant math education video maker, I will attach the link below.(About *Haoni*)

So, our first aim is to make a program to solve the *Haoni* puzzle. what's more, optimization is nesscceary. Furthermore, if you have different view or angle to consider this puzzle, we strongly suggest you create an **Issue**, sometimes changing your view angle can make big change.

Something else:
+ Welcome!
+ The programming language is unlimited(p.s. Because I usually use Python, maybe `@lru_cache` can benefit a lot when applying recursion)
+ Don't be afarid to push your own code here.
